## üöÄ Features
- Displays the most recent commits on the repo's Code tab
- Collapsible sidebar with a toggle button
- Matches GitHub's native styling for a seamless look
- Built with TypeScript for type safety and maintainability

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies
- [x] **TypeScript** for JS typing
- [x] **HTML/CSS** for sidebar structure and styling
- [x] **GitHub REST API** for fetching commit data

## üí° Motivation
I created this project to explore browser extensions, GitHub API integration, and dynamic DOM manipulation. It also demonstrates practical UI/UX skills by enhancing an existing interface on GitHub.

## üîß Installation
*Option 1:* Load as unpacked extension

1. Clone this repo:
```git clone https://github.com/yourusername/github-activity-sidebar.git```

2. Open Chrome > Extensions > Load unpacked > Select repo folder.

3. Navigate to any GitHub repository ‚ÄúCode‚Äù tab to see the sidebar.

*Option 2:* Install [here](https://www.google.com) via Chrome Web Store

## üíª What I Learned / Skills Demonstrated
- Building a browser extension from scratch
- Working with the GitHub REST API
- Using TypeScript effectively for DOM scripting
- Implementing responsive, collapsible UI elements
